# Bharat Herald Analysis & Digital Transformation Roadmap

## ✨ Project Overview
Bharat Herald, a legacy multilingual newspaper with operations across five Indian states, faced a steep decline in print circulation (from 1.2M in 2019 to under 560k in 2024) due to the pandemic and digital-first competitors. This project analyzes operational and financial data (2019–2024) to identify challenges, assess recovery potential, and recommend a phased roadmap for digital transformation.

## ⚡ Objective
1. Track circulation and revenue trends (2019–2024).  
2. Assess print waste, ROI, and city profitability.  
3. Evaluate digital readiness vs. pilot engagement.  
4. Prioritize cities for a phased digital relaunch.  
5. Rebuild advertiser trust and reader engagement.  
6. Explore new revenue models for sustainable growth.

## 🛠 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗱
  • 𝗦𝗤𝗟 – for data cleaning and exploration.
  • 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗜 – for creating dynamic dashboards.
  • 𝗖𝗮𝗻𝘃𝗮 – for presentation-ready storytelling.

## ✅ Overall Story Across All 3 Dashboards
* Print is **shrinking** (both circulation & efficiency declining).
* Revenue is **stable/growing** because of **ad pricing power & FMCG category boost**.
* Digital is **emerging**, with Tier-2 cities showing **higher readiness** and mobile-first platforms (App + WhatsApp) leading adoption.
